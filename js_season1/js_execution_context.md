_ Intially, in memory cell, jS creates memory for each and every variable as undefined and for the functions it will be created like whole strctured function data within curly braces


-  In code phase all variables are replaced with the values instead of undefined and invoke the function
-  when invoke the function again executionn context is created calculate the 'ans' variable and it returns data . once it is completed execution context is deleted
