### Undefined vs not defined

- undefined is coming from a place where javascript is allocated , it's like a placeholder we are getting the value over there

**Js is a loosely typed language(weakly typed language)**

### not defined


- The term "not defined" in JavaScript typically refers to an error condition that occurs when you attempt to use a variable that has not been declared at all.
- It indicates that the interpreter cannot find any declaration for the referenced variable, leading to a ReferenceError.

```Javascript

console.log(a)
var a=7;
console.log(x)
```

- From above snippet x is not defined so that we are getting the not defined
