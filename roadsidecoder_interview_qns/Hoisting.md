## Hoisting
- By Hoisting it means the behavior of moving the variables or function declarations to the top.

- We are accessing the varaiable before intialization and it leads to undefined

 - const and let hoisted in temporal deadzone
 - 
```Javascript
console.log(myLetVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLetVar' before initialization
let myLetVar = 3;

```


#### Function expression hoisting

```javascript
myFunc(); // TypeError: myFunc is not a function

var myFunc = function() {
    console.log("Hello from function expression!");
};
```

- The variable myFunc is hoisted, but its assignment as a function happens at runtime. Hence, trying to call it before the assignment results in a TypeError.
